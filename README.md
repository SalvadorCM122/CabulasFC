# Development Branch

This is the Development branch.

To help, follow these steps:
- No need to create a new branch for everything, just make sure your stuff is **organized**.
- Write *legible*, *understandable* code, with **decent documentation**.
- **Don't modify other people's code**, fork it, do your modifications, and submit.

- You can upload code, solvers, functions, Live Scripts, notes, etc. Just make sure things are organized.

  And most importantly:

  **DONT EVER EVER EVER PUSH TO MAIN (aka Código-Atual) WITHOUT APPROVAL**
  That´s the branch people rely on. Lets make sure it only has approved code. Always upload/push to this branch (desenvolvimento).

  Happy coding! :)
